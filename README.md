This page introduces how to run the Android sample project.

## Prerequisites 

- Make sure you have made the preparations mentioned in the [Agora e-Education Guide](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Usecase/eEducation).
- Prepare the development environment:
  - JDK
  - Android Studio 2.0  or later
- Real Android devices, such as Nexus 5X. We recommend using real devices because some function may not work well on simulators or you may encounter performance issues.

## Run the sample project

- Obtain the App ID, App Certificate in the agora.io console and configure it in string_config.xml.
- Two host-related configurations in string_config.xml are ignored.
- Sync and run the project.
> *However, we strongly do not recommend this insecure solution for locally generating rtmToken. For specific security solutions, please refer to [Generate RTM Token](https://docs.agora.io/en/agora-class/agora_class_prep?platform=Android)。
